## Setup

1. Clone the repository to a local directory.
2. Set up an HTTP App Server in MarkLogic. Set the root to the directory from step 1, and set the port to whatever port number you would like (say, 1338). (See the [MarkLogic docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/getting-started/xquery#id_15787) for detailed instructions.)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:1338/ (substituting your hostname and port number).
